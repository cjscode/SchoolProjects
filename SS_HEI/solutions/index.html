            <li>If we lower the amount of Fossil Fuels burned / used, it could dramatically bring down the increase of <strong>Global Warming</strong>. An example of this is Solar Panels.</li>
            <li>Another is emission of harmful gasses. If we lower the amount of gasses emmited into the air, this could also slow the increase of <strong>Global Warming</strong>. A way we could do this is with Electric Cars or walking and biking.</li>
            <li>Another way is to reuse things and throw away less. If we threw away less trash, it's impact on deforestation is less. Deforestation helps remove harmful gasses in the air, leading to <strong>Global Warming</strong>.</li>
            <li>When you use less energy, we burn less Fossil Fuels. The burning of Fossil Fuels contributes a lot towards <strong>Global Warming</strong>.</li>
