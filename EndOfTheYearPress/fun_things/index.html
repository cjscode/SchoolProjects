        <h2>WOF</h2>
        <p>One of the most fun things i've done this year is going to WOF. I loved going to WOF because of all the rides I went on. I had gone on multiple rides for the first time. Some of those were: The Momba, The Detonator, and The SteelEagle.</p>

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>Another really cool thing I went to during the school year was the Movies. I saw The Super Mario Movie. I would have to say that it was one of my favorite movies ever!</p>
